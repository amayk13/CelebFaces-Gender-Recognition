# Project: CelebFaces - Gender Recognition using Keras

- Practiced machine learning techniques (RNN, CNN, regression).
- Employed power methods for calculating gradient descent for optimizing functions. 
- Secured A+ on face pattern recognition model (with 90%+ accuracy) 2 Neural Net and Logistic Regression algorithms using Keras.
- Concurrent Neural Net was the best followed by Logistic Regression and Recurrent Neural Net.
